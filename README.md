# Furayoshi scripts
these are a series of scripts I created to aid in unusual or repetitive tasks.
Sharing so also others could benefit from.

# How to
I suggest inserting these scripts in a bin directory like `~/bin` and add it to your bin path.

## Config file location
`~/.config/furayoshi/`

# Support me
